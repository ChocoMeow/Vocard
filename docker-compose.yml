# READ THIS BEFORE INSTALL!

# This is a docker-compose file for running Vocard with Lavalink and MongoDB.
# In order to run this, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
# You can install Docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
# and Docker Compose from https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

# Step 1: Start the installation by creating the future config directory for Vocard.
# example - `root@docker:~# mkdir -p /opt/vocard/config`

# Use `cd` to navigate to the config directory.
# example - `root@docker:~# cd /opt/vocard/config`

# Step 3: Choose installation method: Build the image from the Dockerfile or pull it from GitHub(recommended).
# If you chose to pull from Docker Hub, comment the "build" lines and uncomment the "image" line.
# If you chose to build the image from the Dockerfile, do the following:
# uncomment this
#       build:
#           dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
# and comment this
#       image: ghcr.io/choco/vocard:latest
# example - `root@docker:/opt/vocard/config# wget https://github.com/ChocoMeow/Vocard/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

# Step 4: Configure application.yml and settings.json in the config directory.
# In order to avoid silly syntax errors it is recommended to use external code editor such as VS Code or Notepad++.
# Then you can upload files to host using tools such as WinSCP or
# using `nano` to create and edit the files directly using hosts terminal.
# NOTE that some terminals DO NOT let you paste, so you can either use WinSCP or SSH app like Putty.

# example - `root@docker:/opt/vocard/config# nano application.yml`
# example - `root@docker:/opt/vocard/config# nano settings.json`
# To exit nano, press `Ctrl + S`, then `Ctrl + X` to save changes.

# Step 5: If the values are set correctly, you can start the installation by running the following command
# example - `root@docker:/opt/vocard/config# docker-compose up -d`   (could be `docker compose` on some systems)
